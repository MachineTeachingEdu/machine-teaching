Write a program to compute the frequency of the words in a sentence. The output should be a dictionary where the key are the words and the value the respective frequency in the sentence.
Do not worry about punctuation.
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
New to Python or choosing between Python 2 and Python 3? Read Python 2 or Python 3.
Then, the output should be:
{"2":2, "3.":1, "3?":1, "New":1, "Python":5, "Read":1, "and":1, "between":1, "choosing":1, "or":2}

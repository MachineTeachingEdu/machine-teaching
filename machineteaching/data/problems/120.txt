Write a function that computes the net amount of a bank account based a transaction log passed as a list in the function argument. The transaction log format is shown as following:
[('D', 100), ('W', 200)] where D means deposit while W means withdrawal.
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
[('D', 300), ('D', 300), ('W', 200), ('D', 100)]

Then, the output should be:
500

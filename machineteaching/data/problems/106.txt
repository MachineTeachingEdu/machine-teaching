With a given integral number n, write a function that receives n as an argument and generate a dictionary that contains the number from 1 to n (both included) as keys and their square value as the dictionary value for each respective key. The function should return the dictionary.
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
8
Then, the output should be:
{1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16, 5: 25, 6: 36, 7: 49, 8: 64}

Write a function that receives as an argument how old the user is. Return a sentence saying "You are old enough to vote." if they are over 16 years old or "You can vote in X years.", substituting the X with the appropriate number of years. Add another sentence if the user is younger than 65 years old, calculating the number of year missing until they can retire (assume at age 65): ""You can retire in Y years.".

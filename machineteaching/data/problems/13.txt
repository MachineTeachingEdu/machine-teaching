Write a function that receives as an argument the number of how many Fibonnaci numbers to generate and then generates them. Take this opportunity to think about how you can use functions. (Hint: The Fibonnaci seqence is a sequence of numbers where the next number in the sequence is the sum of the previous two numbers in the sequence. The sequence looks like this: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, â€¦)

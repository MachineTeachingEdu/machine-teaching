\chapter{Topics on All Tweets}

This chapter presented for Tweets acquired from October 15, 2015 to November 5, 2015.

The study estimates the presence of 40 topics among the acquired data. Each section of this chapter describes a topic. For each topic, the following information is provided:

\begin{itemize}
\item A Wordcloud of the most relvant terms
\item A chart showing the influence of the 10 most relevant terms on the topic
\item A plot showing the number of tweets per day belonging to that topic
\item A table containing sample tweets from that topic, ordered by relevance
\end{itemize}

The table of sample tweets contains the text and two additional columns: Count and Rel. The Count column shows how many tweets contained exactly that text. The value in the Rel column is the relevance of that tweet to the topic, in a scale of 0 to 1.
